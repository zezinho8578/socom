<h2 style="text-align: center;">RULES OF ENGAGEMENT</h2>
<h2>Be Civil, Be Respectful.</h2> <p>SOCOM is intended to be a dark and intense game, but we're all here to have fun. Horror is in-character and respect is out-of-character. Don't make it personal and don't take things to the heart.</p>
<h2>About PvP.</h2> <p>Tension between characters happens - distrust, paranoia, and conflicting agendas are part of the setting. But player consent is key before betrayal, sabotage, or character-on-character violence. NEMESIS will not tolerate out-of-character grudges; keep the drama in the game.</p>
<h2>Communication and Versimilitude.</h2> <p>If you're unsure about something, ask - NEMESIS will always answer. Work with the other players to build suspense and tension and keep the setting immersive. Paranoia is more fun with friends.</p>
<h2>Death (and Worse) is Part of the Game.</h2> <p>Your character is not a hero, and they are not safe. SOCOM is about failure, creeping dread, and moral collapse with the occasional success. Expect your character to die, disappear, go insane, or worse. When that happens, we'll work together to bring in a new agent.</p>
<h2>No Metagaming, No Powergaming</h2> <p>Metagaming (using OOC knowledge IC) ruins the experience - act on what your character knows, not what you do. Powergaming (forcing actions on others or breaking realism) doesn't fit this setting. Be prepared for failures and bad choices.</p>
<h2>Trust NEMESIS, but Question Everything</h2> <p>NEMESIS is not your enemy, but will make your character suffer. If something seems off in the story, that's probably intentional. Keep your eyes open. Assume you're being lied to. And remember that no one is coming to save you.</p>
